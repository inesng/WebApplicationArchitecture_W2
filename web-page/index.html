    <h1> Hello & Welcome </h1>
    <p> Since lots of people are depressed by the virus,
      I decided to give joy to everyone by creating a website with pictures of my idole:
      <strong> The one and only Mimi Mathy !</strong>
       Mimi Mathy is one of my idols because I am not able to snap my fingers like her.
       She truly is an example of finger snap.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mimi Mathy snapping her fingers</li>
      <img src='IMAGES/mimimathy.jpg' />

      <li> Mimi Mathy celebrating life </li>
      <img src='IMAGES/joy.gif' />

      <li> People full of joy because they saw Mimi Mathy</li>
      <img src='IMAGES/200.gif'/>
    </ul>
